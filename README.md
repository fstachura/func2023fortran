# Simple Fortran Interpreter

Simple Fortran interpreter written in Haskell. The only used library is the standard Prelude.

This project was submitted as the final project of the Functional Programming course at Jagiellonian University.

Simplified and not entirely correct grammar accepted by the interpreter can be seen in [grammar.md](grammar.md).

## How to run

```
make
./main examples/prime.f90
```
